    <h2>Setting</h2>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of The Painted Lands is one where the setting is king. The land is steeped in history and over many years has absorbed the blood and memories of its people, due to a special feature of the humans of The Painted Lands: when they die, their body returns to the earth, and after their blood and psyches mix with that of the many who have died in the same land, they return to life. The very earth itself creates for them a new body, with physical and mental changes influenced by the features of the fallen whom they've mixed with. Regular births and deaths due to old age still occur, and frequently, those who fall due to injuries or illness do not return, their psyches shattered after too many cycles of death and rebirth. However, the average person can expect that, after succumbing to fever or being slain by the weapon of another, that they will return, although they may not be quite the same person that they were before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultures of the people of The Painted Lands are thus closely linked to their ancestral homes and the proclivities of the people who have been there before them. When they die, they become a little more like their ancestors, or even their former neighbors and family members, causing a powerful degree of homogenization amongst a land's people. Humans are both tied down by their fear of the changes that death might bring about and terrified of the prospect of not being able to revive. Homes are built with single stories and floors of packed dirt. People are hesitant to go out on boats or to ride in the backs of carriages. They sleep on the hard earth and surround themselves with nature. They refrain from travel, knowing that dying on foreign soil might mean they return as someone entirely different, with new ideals and beliefs, that might lead them to avoid returning to family and friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, people treat the land reverently. They grow crops and plant flowers to enrich themselves and the land itself. They understand that they are part of life's natural cycle. They keep to their own communities and adapt themselves to the unique features of their particular location, whether it be carefully controlling deforestation in a forest or sticking to caves in a hot desert. The Painted Lands are dotted with many communities that keep to themselves and fear getting involved with others. Despite this, raiding and banditry abound, as people are forced to travel far from home in search of resources. And because news does not travel far and trade is paltry between nation-states, tyrants rule within their communities and localized crime persists in many otherwise peaceful lands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players of The Painted Lands take on the unique job of the Vagabond. For a variety of possible reasons, including forced exile or wanderlust, vagabonds have chosen to leave the comfort of their homelands in search of new horizons. The name vagabond carries a negative connotation; no matter where the players go, they will find no such thing as a new home. That being said, vagabonds are afforded special treatment due to their unique nature as travelers. Villages and cities are honorbound to provide succor and treat them hospitably, although kindness isn't necessarily part of the deal. In exchange, vagabonds too are honorbound to fulfill certain obligations to the world itself. Firstly, they act as emissaries, uniting distant lands, helping to forge peace treaties and trade agreements, and mediating disputes to help avoid full fledged warfare. Secondly, they act as caravanserai, transporting goods and people safely from point to point, stimulating economies and travel. Thirdly, they are problem solvers and tested combatants, dealing with local threats and solving crimes. Players will travel many lands, forging new relationships with entire groups of people, and they can seek to make their own fortunes or become heroes on a global scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the terrifying changes that come with death are also present for vagabonds. Players will forge onwards while their character's personalities and skill sets transform, and death cannot save them from their responsibilities.</p>
