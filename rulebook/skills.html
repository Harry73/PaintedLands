    <h3>Weapon Skills</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 15 Skills in The Painted Lands: 6 Weapon Skills, which dictate the Moves you can use with one of 6 weapon types; 6 Vagabond Skills, which are needed for Skill Checks; and 3 Magic Skills, which dictate the spells a character knows and their strength. Each Skill begins at Level 1 and can rise as high as Level 50. Characters will fill niches in their party based on the Skills they have chosen to put experience in.</p>
<br>
<a id="Axes">
    <h4>Axes</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Axes Skill dictates the use of axe type weapons. Axes do not perform well at low Poise, and they struggle to build Poise, but they are the strongest weapon at high Poise. The weapon class has access to powerful and frequent Critical Strikes, and its Area Of Effect (AOE) damage is respectable. The mobility provided by the class tends to be forwards rather than backwards, and while the personal buffs are strong, the class has little in the way of utility to provide to other party members. Axes are best for players who wish to carry their team through tough fights with their own power and effort, and are a great choice for those looking to play primary damage dealer in the party.</p>
<br>
<a id="Blunt">
    <h4>Blunt</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blunt Skill dictates the use of blunt weapons like maces, flails, and clubs. As a counterpart to axes, blunt weapons have some of the best low Poise moves and respectable Poise generation, although their high Poise moves leave something to be desired, and their Critical Strikes are notably weak. The weapon type has access to good personal and party defensive utility, and is especially effective when paired with a shield in the Frontline. A strong backwards mobility moveset as well as powerful forced maneuver moves rounds out the weapon's strong base. Blunt weapons are best for players looking to dictate the pace of the fight while remaining staunch in their defense, and are a great choice for those looking to be the stalwart ally that others look to in desperate times.</p>
<br>
<a id="Longblades">
    <h4>Longblades</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Longblades skill dictates the use of swords, rapiers, and other similar bladed weapons. This Skill's moveset boasts the best variety and flexibility of all weapon types. With moderate levels of Poise dependence, decent low and high Poise moves, and moderately strong Poise generation and damage, longblades represent the middle ground that all other weapons are balanced around. The variety in the moveset allows for a player to create their own style of combat as well as adapt to any sort of situation. Longblades lend to a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none playstyle. They are a good choice for any player who wishes to constantly change the way they fight or have access to tools that are effective in any situation, and are a great choice for those looking to fill in for the party's needs as they change over the course of an adventure.</p>
<br>
<a id="Polearms">
    <h4>Polearms</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polearms Skill dictates the use of spears, halberds, glaives, and the like. This weapon type has some unique advantages. Due to the reaching nature of the weapon, many Moves ignore certain positional Disadvantages, being effective even from the Midline or Backline. The weapon type also excels at dealing Poise Damage, making it an effective tool to control enemy momentum. There are a number of powerful reactive moves to prevent enemy Maneuvers and weaken enemy damage output. Uniquely, polearms are especially effective when mounted; their Moveset boasts the highest number of Moves that excel while the user is mounted on an animal. They are a good choice for thoughtful players who look to provide high amounts of utility and seek to exploit counterplay, and are a great choice for those looking to play a strong supporting role.</p>
<br>
<a id="Ranged">
    <h4>Ranged</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ranged Skill dictates the use of bows, crossbows, slings, and other weapons that fire ammunition over long distances. Ranged weapons are even better than polearms at ignoring positional Disadvantage, making them extremely effective to use from the Backline. Their damage is low, but many of their Moves have improved accuracy, compounding on their Disadvantage ignorance from the Backline. Their freedom to target any enemy makes them good for sniping key targets that are otherwise safe behind a tanky Frontline, and they have a respectable amount of AOE and utility to work with as well. They are a good choice for cautious players who feel more comfortable assisting from the rear, and are a great choice for those looking for freedom of choice in their aggressive playstyles.</p>
<br>
<a id="Shortblades">
    <h4>Shortblades</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shortblades Skill dictates the use of daggers, shortswords, and other small bladed weapons. Shortblades have low base damage, but excel with their powerful and frequent Critical Strikes. Their overall damage output might be lower than axes, but they don't suffer from weak low Poise moves or poor Poise generation. They have a large variety of powerful self buffs, mobility, personal defensive utility, and offensive utility. While their damage might falter without luck on your side, they make up for this by inflicting powerful Damage Over Time (DOT) effects as they build up their Poise. They are a good choice for players who like to let luck grant them memorable moments, and are a great choice for those looking to provide damage in a less straightforward manner.</p>
<br>

<a id="Runekeeping">
    <h4>Runekeeping</h4>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Runekeeping Skill dictates the use of runic magic. In The Painted Lands, magic can be drawn from nature and focused upon a rune, which can then be applied by touch to an object or person.

<br>
<a id="Mentalism">
