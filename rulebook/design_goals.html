    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last game was hopelessly complex to the point that it was by no means a publishable product. Most of my players only knew how to play a fraction of the game, and I even had one player retire a character whose abilities had gotten too complicated to reasonably manage. The Painted Lands will have easier, more straightforward combat and much fewer, broader skills.</p>

<a id="Flavor">
    <h3>Flavor</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large downside of the previous product was that many classes and abilities were lacking in flavor, and some mechanics were poorly tied to their own flavor. The goal this time is to have a common flavor theme in the land itself and tie everything about the world to this. That's why magic is tied so closely to the earth, and death mechanics require standing on the ground.</p>

<a id="Skill">
    <h3>Skill</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat system should encourage player skill. It's simple in that everyone gets a single move to use each turn, but constantly changing turn orders and the chance to predict an enemy's moves provide the chance to show off a heavy level of skill. Managing your poise is simple but paramount to success, and a wide variety of moves to pick from give everyone the chance to build their specific playstyle.</p>

<a id="Fiction First">
    <h3>Fiction First</h3>
</a>
<p>The game should encourage players to roleplay and seek solutions through roleplay and skill usage without forcing them to look at a list of skills and figure out how the mechanics can help them. A lot of problems should be able to be solved by good roleplay, and experience should be granted by using your skills well and roleplaying your characters well.</p>
