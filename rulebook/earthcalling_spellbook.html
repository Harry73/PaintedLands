    <h2>Earthcalling Spellbook</h2>
</a>
<p>Toll the Dead</p>
<p>Cast Time: 10 minutes</p>
<p>Material Requirements: bones, cursed effigies, rusted or damaged weapons</p>
<p>Location Requirements: a land where many have died in a short period of time</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You find a location where many people have died in a short period of time sometime in the past, such as during a war or due to a plague, and you create a focal point for many spirits within the earth to gather. These spirits rise from the earth and can be interacted with as if they were alive, captured for use in later spells, recruited for assistance over longer periods of time, tasked with missions or complete or messages to deliver, etc. Spirits are not necessarily useful, helpful, or willing to help, and they may need to be convinced one way or another. After completing this Earthcall, the spirits in this location become enraged, potentially increasing the risk of danger to others traveling or living in the area or disrupting human activity in the area. A short list of options for effects for this Earthcall include:</p>
<p>Each party member can capture a spirit for use in a Spiritwrest of their choice that they know, ignoring requirements for types of spirits for the chosen Spiritwrest</p>
<p>You question a spirit or a group or spirits, having a limited number of questions based on an Allure Skill Test (1 question on a failure, 3 on a partial success, 5 on a complete success)</p>
<p>A spirit becomes bound to your group and assists in your current quest, gaining its own pool of Health and assisting you until this pool of Health depletes or your task is complete, success or failure.</p>
