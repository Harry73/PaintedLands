<p>Dear Reader:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development on The Painted Lands began in January of 2020. At this point, my previous TTRPG, BARBS, had been successfully run in two separate campaigns, made up of my usual group of friends who played the games that I was DM for. For all intents and purposes, BARBS was an extremely successful project. It successfully captured the feel of its predecessor, my hack of Barbarians of Lemuria, while providing superior balance and stronger classes. I hope to continue to run BARBS for many years to come, as my groups have only scratched the surface of the nearly 200 classes available in the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, BARBS isn't without its flaws, some of which are fairly significant and cause me headaches to this day. The game is hopelessly complex, which was part of my original intention, but I failed in many ways to tie these complex mechanics and classes to their intended flavor. The system was originally setting agnostic, until the addition of classes like Vastwood Knight broke that promise. Many of my playtesters, who have been playing the game for over 2 years now, confess that they know little of how the system works beyond how to operate their own class. I've even had a player scrap an entire character because of how complex their combat style was. Ultimately, the whole thing feels somewhat too gamey, in the sense that players grind for AP and mostly have their fun slowly powering up their builds instead of having fun with the fiction itself. None of these are issues that would lead me to call BARBS a failure, but eventually I found myself hungering for a different kind of system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside running BARBS, I spent a lot of the past few years researching a variety of systems, and found myself attracted to barebones systems like Knave and Mouse Guard, as well as fiction-first systems like Band of Blades and Ironsworn. There's beauty in simplicity, and cutting away the fat seems to give players the opportunity to focus more on roleplay and on story. Having recently scrapped an attempt to create a non-combat, non-Vancian magic-focused RPG, I developed the Poise Combat System that features in The Painted Lands over the course of a few nights, and was inspired to try my hand at a barebones, fiction-first game with a deep and skillful combat system. Here we are about a year later; I'm very close to completing development, so I've officially begun the game's rulebook. Unlike BARBS, I'm hoping to make this the kind of game that the average RPG player will like, rather than a tailor made experience for my group of friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of them, as with my previous project, I'd like to thank my friends/players/playtesters who have stuck with me throughout the years and made BARBS the success that it was. I'm not going to name any names here; you know who you are and how much you did for me, and more importantly, how much you mean to me. I hope that this next project will mark a new era for us, and while I can't promise that all of you will like The Painted Lands, given how different it is from BARBS, I hope that at the very least you'll celebrate the development of my third RPG with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without further ado, let's get started.</p>
