    <h3>Skill Tests</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Painted Lands is a 2d6 system; with the exception of damage dice, every roll players will need to make will be 2d6. There are 14 skills: 6 are called Vagabond skills, and make up the typical sort of skills one would need to travel the lands, interact with people, and gather information. A character's Vagabond skills represent their strengths and weaknesses in body and mind. For a player, your highest rated Vagabond skills represent your niche in the party outside of combat encounters: characters with high Vigor will be kicking doors down while characters with high Intellect will research old, dusty tomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Vagabond skill is rated from 2 to 5; the wealth of a Vagabond's experiences combined with the harrowing threats a Vagabond comes across means no one is too poor or too excellent at anything. You roll 2d6 when performing a Vagabond skill test and evaluate each die value rolled separately instead of taking their sum. This represents the random elements that are hard to account for in a skill check (unknown reinforcement in a door being kicked down or deteriorating of pages in an old, dusty tome being studied), and it's compared to your Vagabond skill rating (a relatively static measure of your ability) in a "roll under" mechanic. If both dice are higher than your rating in the skill, you fail the skill test. If only one die value is higher than your rating in the skill, you get a partial success. If both dice values are equal to or lower than your rating in the skill, you get a full success. The DM defines the results of each of these based on the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, let's say a player is breaking a door down. A complete success might mean the door takes someone out on the other side, while a partial success might mean that an enemy waiting on the other side goes in for a swing at the player, and a failure means the door breaks but an entire building's worth of guards swarm the party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside literal consequences of skill test results, you also have various levers to play with as the DM to reward complete successes or penalize failures. Perhaps a complete success and a partial success result in the same story consequences, but the complete success gives poise to the player. Maybe a failure requires a player to lose a piece of gear in exchange for moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A DM can provide advantage or disadvantage if circumstances surrounding a skill test demand it. In the case of either, the player rolls 3d6 instead. With advantage, ignore the highest rolled result. With disadvantage, ignore the lowest rolled result. You could alternatively provide a -1 to one or both rolled dice in a Skill Test, functionally improving the player's odds of rolling under their Vagabond skill level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rulebook has no strict rules about how to adjudicate the results of a skill test. This author's recommendation is to consider how many reasonable and interesting outcomes there could be for a player's skill test and then map them to failure, partial success, and complete success results. Let's say that the player asks you, the DM, "Hey DM, can I do X?" If there is only 1 reasonable and interesting outcome that you can think of, there probably does not need to be a skill test. You'd tell the player, "Yes, you're successful and it happens," or "No, that's not possible, would you like to try Y?" or something along those lines. If there are 2 reasonable and interesting outcomes that you can think of, one can be tied to failure on the skill test, and the other can be a partial success, while a complete success would mirror the partial success but also provide some sort of meta-bonus such as Poise, advantage on a future roll, etc. If there are 3 reasonable and interesting outcomes that you can think of, you can map each of them to failure, partial success, and complete success as appropriate. If there are 4 or more reasonable and interesting outcomes that you can think of, you can employ multiple skill tests, perhaps nesting them within each other and forcing your player to try and roll multiple successes (a very simple example: a player rolls Finesse to unlock a chest with a heavy stone lid, then Vigor to actually push the lid aside to open the chest). These are not rules about how one should adjudicate skill test resolution, just guidelines for those who are used to more discrete instructions on how to resolve similar sorts of rolls from other games.</p>

<a id="Combat">
    <h3>Combat</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combat, players have two resources they manage: Health and Poise. Health is an abstraction of how many wounds a character can take; when Health reaches zero, the character dies, and their body rapidly decomposes into the earth, leaving behind their items. Poise is an abstraction of things like morale, tactical position, and general momentum in combat. Poise is initially determined by the group for each individual member participating in the fight, including enemies. Things like being surprised or tired might mean starting at lower Poise, while having advanced information or knowledge of the terrain might mean starting at higher Poise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each round of combat consists of one turn for each participant, and each turn consists of a single Action. Both teams discuss what their plans are for the round, then turn order is set by the Poise order at the start of the round. Aside from speaking, everything that a character does is an Action, including using an item, Maneuvering to a new position, or executing a Weapon Move. These Weapon Moves are the bulk of what Actions will be used for, and usually consist of an Attack Roll, Damage, and Poise Cost. 	The Attack Roll is 2d6, which can be modified by gear or by certain Weapon Moves and can be affected by Advantage or Disadvantage. The goal is to match or beat the target's Armor Class (AC); if you do, you deal Damage based on a Damage Dice Roll defined by the Move you are executing. You also resolve any Effects that the Move might have. Afterwards, you pay any costs, which will primarily be a Poise Cost, reducing your current Poise by a set amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with Moves that increase your Poise, you will execute a series of Moves over the course of combat, and your Poise will go up and down as a result. Some Moves have a Poise Requirement; they not only cost Poise to execute, but also require that your Poise before you execute the move is at least a certain amount. These high Poise Moves tend to be stronger and deal more damage, whereas low Poise Moves and moves that gain you Poise tend to be weaker. Combat, thus, is a dance of high and low Poise moves as you constantly compete with your enemies for superior Poise and eventually deplete their Health. Additionally, some attacks damage the Poise of the target, which could even cause them to lose their action if they had a high Poise move prepared for their turn later that round. Combat continues until all members of one side are dead or one side surrenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Weapon Moves will say things like "+1 Accuracy Token" or "+1 Armor Token". This means you get an expendable token, most easily represented by coins or other small objects, which can be spent for the effect of increasing an Attack Roll or temporarily increasing your AC in response to an enemy attack. You can have up to 3 tokens at any time, in any mix of types of tokens, and they can be spent however you need to modify your attack rolls and AC at any time. Tokens are lost at the end of combat. Notably, some Weapon Moves have Modifier effects instead of providing tokens, which only apply to the rolls for that Weapon Move. Additionally, additional effects of Weapon Moves that trigger on specific roll results only trigger on a natural roll of that result; an Accuracy Token can't earn you those effects, and so they're best used to make moves that barely miss into moves that hit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other actions in combat include:</p>
<p>Swap Gear: change what you have equipped in both main hand and off hand in a single action (i.e., switching from a longblade and a shield to a shortblade and a gauntlet)</p>
<p>Basic Maneuver: maneuver to an adjacent line</p>
<p>Interact: interact as an action with something in the area, typically for a known and concrete effect in combat</p>
<p>Use an Item: expend a consumable item for a one time effect</p>

<a id="Position">
    <h3>Position</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of grid based combat that you might be used to from other games, The Painted Lands abstracts the relative positions of participants in combat to specific positions or "lines". Players and their enemies choose an initial position, and they can use their Action to Maneuver into an adjacent position. The three normal positions are also called lines, and consist of the Frontline, Midline, and Backline. In the Frontline, participants in combat have a level of advantage on their enemy Frontline; their attacks are normal on the enemy Midline, and they have a level of disadvantage on the enemy Backline. In the Midline, one has normal attacks on the enemy Frontline, one level of disadvantage on the enemy midline, and two levels of disadvantage on the enemy backline. In the Backline, you have one level of disadvantage on the frontline, two levels of disadvantage on the midline, and three levels of disadvantage on the backline. The easiest way to calculate whether an attack is being made with advantage, disadvantage, or neither is to assume the attack starts at advantage, then add a level of disadvantage for every line between the move user and the move target. Alongside the Maneuver action are Weapon Moves that also cause the user to Maneuver to a new position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in any given combat, there might be Special Positions available based on environmental factors. Examples include a marshy spot or a large rock. Such positions can provide functional AC in the form of cover or provide other sorts of bonuses or penalties. The DM is encouraged to be creative in their selection of the rules of these Special Positions; the rulebook does not look to define the limits of such positions. Many moves require that the user is in a certain type of Special Position; for example, one might need to stand in water or be behind cover. It would be prudent for the DM to include these kinds of Special Positions frequently so that both players and their enemies can make use of them.</p>

<a id="Magic">
    <h3>Magic</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two schools of magic exist in The Painted Lands: Earthcalling and Spiritwresting. There are two magic skills that represent your character's level in each of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earthcalling is a form of ritual based casting that exploits the natural magic held deep within the earth in specific locations; each Earthcall has wildly different outcomes based on intent, circumstances, ingredients, and setting. The casting process takes minutes to hours and the effects tend to last for long periods of times or move great amounts of magical power. Determining the end result of an Earthcall will depend on a discussion between DM and caster in which they apply the description of the Earthcall to their situation and modify aspects of it to suit their needs. Earthcalling is for players who are mostly interested in out-of-combat spell casting where their creativity can be used to its fullest extent using the flexible and thoughtful nature of ritual-based casting. DMs are encouraged to interpret the description of any Earthcall being cast with a generous level of flexibility, and while some minimum level of effect is encouraged for any Earthcall being cast, DMs are encouraged to provide further benefits in exchange for Vagabond Skill Tests, Poise or Health expenditure, or material sacrifice. Each Earthcall entry in this rulebook lists a few options for what the Earthcall is capable of, but those lists are not exhaustive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritwresting is a form of casting more suitable for combat due to its rapid execution speed. By forcibly drawing upon the emotions and intents of a spirit buried deep within the land or capturing the essence of an enemy recently slain, a caster can release this energy in the form of short bursts of magical power. The end result is usually a brief spell that is best used during a combat encounter. Spiritwrests cost specific kinds of spiritual energy harvested from slain enemies (or in rare cases obtained by other methods), so they can be collected after a fight to spend later on future Spiritwrests. At the end of each combat, each player may capture a spirit from a slain enemy and select a Spiritwrest they know that can accept the type of spirit they captured, and charge the Spiritwrest for later use. Spirits have types based on their source (human, beast, monster, undead, etc) and their dominant personality traits or emotions (vengeful, sorrowful, joyful, etc)Spiritwrests are all a single action to cast and have very well defined results that have no wiggle room to be modified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each level of Earthcalling or Spiritwresting gives a player access to a single spell of the player's choice of that school; players can thus start at level 0 in this skill, unlike Weapon Skills. Earthcalls can only be cast in specific locations in the world where natural magic in the earth is strong. Spiritwrests can only be cast if a spirit can be spent that was collected earlier in the day; resting releases all currently held spirits. Spiritwrests can only be cast once per rest, and Earthcalls can usually only be cast once period in any given location that has enough magic as the Earthcall will deplete magic in that area (and thus possibly have long standing consequences).</p>
<br>
<a id="Poise Rerolls and Rests">
    <h3>Poise Rerolls and Rests</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of combat, you have a Poise level as well. On its own, it does not affect any actions you are allowed to take, but it can be spent to reroll Vagabond skill checks. After the GM gives you the result for your Vagabond skill check, you can spend 5 Poise to reattempt the skill check; each subsequent reroll costs 5 more Poise than the last on any single particular task. So if you fail to knock a door down, rerolling costs 5 Poise, and if you fail again, another reroll costs 10 Poise, but if you then succeed only to find that you now have to jump across a chasm, you'd be back to spending 5 Poise to reroll if you fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter combat, whatever your Poise level is at when the combat begins is your starting Poise for that combat. So, in other words, the more you push yourself by spending Poise to reroll your skill checks outside of combat, the lower your Poise will be once a fight breaks out. After the fight is over, your Poise returns to whatever level it was at the beginning of the fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you rest for at least 6 hours, which is defined by having full body contact with the bare earth for that duration, you reset your Poise back to 50. You can also increase your Poise throughout the adventuring day when you accomplish tasks that provide brief rest, give you strategic or tactical advantage, lift your emotional state, or anything else that refreshes or emboldens you according to the GM. For example, your GM might award every member of the team 5 Poise for scouting out a bandit camp before attacking it, or your character alone might be awarded 10 Poise when they give a rousing speech to others that is consistent with their character's ideals and motivations. The GM should grant Poise whenever they feel they want to reward the players for their choices and their roleplay.</p>
