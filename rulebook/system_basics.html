    <h3>Skill Checks</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Painted Lands is a 2d6 system; with the exception of damage dice, every roll players will need to make will be 2d6, with possible modifiers added based on things like skill levels and equipment. There are 15 skills: 6 are called Vagabond skills, and make up the typical sort of skills one would need to travel the lands, interact with people, and gather information. Rolling one of these skills involves rolling 2d6, plus any modifiers accorded to the player from vagabond skill levels or gear, with a goal of beating a certain Difficulty Check (DC) as defined by the Dungeon Master (DM). It would be wise for the DM to pick an array of DCs with varying results; instead of saying the DC is 8, you could additionally have 7 correspond to, "No, but…" and 9 could be "Yes, and…" The system prefers to put the fiction first; we don't bother rolling to persuade an NPC that someone else has already tried to persuade unless we have a good reason, and we don't roll any dice at all if the characters words alone are enough to convince the NPC. The dice are only to be used when the fiction requires characters to attempt something without a guaranteed result; many sessions might end without anyone having rolled any Skill Checks. The degree to which any particular group wants to use the dice might vary. If certain factors are in your favor, you have Advantage on your Skill Check; you roll 3d6 and take the higher two results. Likewise, you can have Disadvantage; you roll 3d6 and take the lower two results. You can have multiple levels of either Advantage and Disadvantage; each pair of Advantage/Disadvantage cancels each other out, meaning whatever you have more of is how you roll.</p>

    <h3>Combat</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combat, players have two resources they manage: Health and Poise. Health is an abstraction of how many wounds a character can take; when Health reaches zero, the character dies, and their body rapidly decomposes into the earth, leaving behind their items. Poise is an abstraction of things like morale, tactical position, and general momentum in combat. Poise is initially determined by the group for each individual member participating in the fight, including enemies. Things like being surprised or tired might mean starting at lower Poise, while having advanced information or knowledge of the terrain might mean starting at higher Poise. Each round of combat consists of one turn for each participant, and each turn consists of a single Action. Both teams discuss what their plans are for the round, then turn order is set by the Poise order at the start of the round. Aside from speaking, everything that a character does is an Action, including using an item, Maneuvering to a new position, or executing a Weapon Move. These Weapon Moves are the bulk of what Actions will be used for, and usually consist of an Attack Roll, Damage, and Poise Cost. The Attack Roll is 2d6, which can be modified by gear or by Accuracy Modifiers in certain Weapon Moves and can be affected by Advantage or Disadvantage. The goal is to match or beat the target's Armor Class (AC); if you do, you deal Damage based on a Damage Dice Roll defined by the Move you are executing. You also resolve any Effects that the Move might have. Afterwards, you pay any costs, which will primarily be a Poise Cost, reducing your current Poise by a set amount. Along with Moves that increase your Poise, you will execute a series of Moves over the course of combat, and your Poise will go up and down as a result. Some Moves have a Poise Requirement; they not only cost Poise to execute, but also require that your Poise before you execute the move is at least a certain amount. These high Poise Moves tend to be stronger and deal more damage, whereas low Poise Moves and moves that gain you Poise tend to be weaker. Combat, thus, is a dance of high and low Poise moves as you constantly compete with your enemies for superior Poise and eventually deplete their Health. Additionally, some attacks damage the Poise of the target, which could even cause them to lose their action if they had a high Poise move prepared for their turn later that round. Combat continues until all members of one side are dead or one side surrenders.</p>

    <h3>Position</h3>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of grid based combat that you might be used to from other games, The Painted Lands abstracts the relative positions of participants in combat to specific positions or "lines". Players and their enemies choose an initial position, and they can use their Action to Maneuver into an adjacent position. The three normal positions are also called lines, and consist of the Frontline, Midline, and Backline. In the Frontline, participants in combat have a level of advantage on their enemy Frontline; their attacks are normal on the enemy Midline, and they have a level of disadvantage on the enemy Backline. In the Midline, one has normal attacks on the enemy Frontline, one level of disadvantage on the enemy midline, and two levels of disadvantage on the enemy backline. In the Backline, you have one level of disadvantage on the frontline, two levels of disadvantage on the midline, and three levels of disadvantage on the backline. Alongside the Maneuver action are Weapon Moves that also cause the user to Maneuver to a new position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in any given combat, there might be Special Positions available based on environmental factors. Examples include a marshy spot or a large rock. Such positions can provide functional AC in the form of cover or provide other sorts of bonuses or penalties. The DM is encouraged to be creative in their selection of the rules of these Special Positions; the rulebook does not look to define the limits of such positions. Many moves require that the user is in a certain type of Special Position; for example, one might need to stand in water or be behind cover. It would be prudent for the DM to include these kinds of Special Positions frequently so that both players and their enemies can make use of them.</p>
