    <h2>Character Creation</h2>
</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the entirety of a character's build comes down to the skills they choose to focus on leveling during gameplay, character creation comes down mainly to deciding on aspects of your character's physical features and personality traits. The Painted Lands does not support the existence of multiple races; technically speaking, your game could have elves and dwarves alongside humans, but this rulebook provides no rules for how to differentiate these races mechanically, and advises strongly against homebrewing races with functional differences. Should you wish to include multiple races purely for flavor reasons, please do so. Otherwise, players create humans with whatever physical features are typical for our species. Given that physical features are interchangeable every time a character dies, they will not serve any mechanical purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important details come down to personality aspects of your character. Players should write down at least two personality traits that they intend to roleplay during the character's lifetime; at least one of these should be related to the character's unique relationship to the land (examples include insisting on sleeping on hard earth or an affinity for flowers). These are subject to change throughout gameplay, as each death forces personality changes upon the character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we round out character creation by selecting some starting Skills. This rulebook recommends starting a fresh character with 10 levels in their chosen Weapon Skill and 5 levels in up to 3 other Skills; at most one of these may be a Magic Skill, while the other two must be Vagabond Skills. DMs should feel free to change the starting Skill lineup however they wish.</p>
